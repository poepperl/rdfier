    This module was developed as part of Luca P√∂pperl's master's thesis in order to investigate different models for uncertainty
    in RDF graphs and to perform benchmark tests with them.
    This web application provides a simple way to convert CSV data into RDF graphs using a mapping syntax,
    which is described in more detail on the [üìùInput Format](http://localhost:8501/Input_Format) page.

    On the [Home](http://localhost:8501) page, custom csv tables can be entered and the resulting graph displayed.
    After a csv file has been uploaded, further configurations can be made:
    - First, the entered csv table is displayed. All fields of the table can be edited, and by clicking on a column header,
    the respective columns can be sorted.
    - In the area "RDF Format" the output format (Turtle or XML) can be selected.
    - By deactivating "Show graph figure", the graph is only output in a text field in the selected format.
    By default, a graphical representation is also generated for inputs with less than 30 rows.
    - Also, the uncertainty model can be selected. The numbering of the models is equivalent to the numbering in the master thesis.
    - By uploading a prefix table, prefixes, which are contained in the input, can be linked to the desired namespaces.
    These must be entered in csv format, which expects a table with the columns (prefix,namespace).

    Now the RDF graph can be generated. Once a graph has been generated, all of the above configurations can be adjusted "live",
    so that the effects on the graph can be seen.
